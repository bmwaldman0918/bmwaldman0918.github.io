Python program that simulates and displays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's game of life</a> on a pixelated version of today's date.
The program uses Numpy to create a 2D array that tracks which squares in the game are 'alive' or 'dead' and displays the grid using pygame.
By default, the program will simulate the game on a pixelized version of today's date but arbitrary other dates can be passed to it.
