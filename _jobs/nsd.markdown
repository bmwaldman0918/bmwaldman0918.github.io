I worked for five weeks as a Lincoln-Douglas instructor at NSD's 2021 <a href="https://www.nationalsymposiumfordebate.com/flagship">Flagship</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalsymposiumfordebate.com/philadelphia-lincoln-douglas">Philadelphia</a> sessions.

At both sessions, I helped develop and teach a curriculum to a class of approximately 10 students. I was also personally responsible for a "mentor group" of four students where I would offer individualized feedback on their preparation and practice sessions.
