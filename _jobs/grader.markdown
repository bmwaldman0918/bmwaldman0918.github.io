I worked as a grader for <a href="https://cs.uchicago.edu/academics/undergraduate/new-introductory-computer-science-sequence/">CMSC 14100: Introduction to Computer Science 1</a> during Winter quarter of 2023. The class was taught by Anne Rogers.

My responsibilities consisted of grading Python code for accuracy and style.
