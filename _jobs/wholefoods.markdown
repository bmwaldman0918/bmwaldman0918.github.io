I worked a part time job as an online shopper at Whole Foods Market. I was responsible for filling out online orders and organizing ("staging") orders for delivery. While I was unable to continue working at Whole Foods when I returned to college, I was encouraged by my then-manager to work at Whole Foods again this upcoming summer.
