<h4>Who are you? </h4>
I'm Ben. I study <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/">computer science&#128187;</a> and <a href="https://economics.uchicago.edu/content/ba-economics-specialization-data-science">Economics with a specialization in Data Science&#128520;</a> at the University of Chicago.

<h4>What are you interested in? </h4>
I'm broadly interested in politics, economics and computer science. I'm especially interested in elections (particularly <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/">electoral districts</a>), behavioral economics and data structures. I also have a weird fascination with transportation infrastructure like my beloved D.C. metro&#128646;.

<h4>What do you do? </h4>
On campus, I work on UChicago's college model UN conference, <a href="https://www.chomun.org/">ChoMUN</a>. I'm also a Lincoln-Douglas debate coach for Scarsdale High School and a former instructor for both the <a href="https://www.nationalsymposiumfordebate.com/">National Symposium for Debate </a> and the <a href="https://www.vbidebate.com/">Victory Briefs Institute</a>.

I also like baking&#127838;, fantasy football&#127944; and roller coasters&#127906;.
