<h3> Who are you? </h3>
I'm Ben. I study <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/">computer science&#128187;</a> at the University of Chicago.

<h3> What are you interested in? </h3>
I'm broadly interested in politics, economics and computer science. I'm especially interested in elections (and <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/">the drawing of electoral districts</a>) and data structures. I also have a weird fascination with transportation infrastructure, especially my beloved D.C. metro &#128646;.

 <h3> What do you do? </h3>
I work on UChicago's college model UN conference, <a href="https://www.chomun.org/">CHOMUN </a>. I'm also a Lincoln-Douglas debate coach for Scarsdale High School and a former instructor for both the <a href="https://www.nationalsymposiumfordebate.com/">National Symposium for Debate </a> and the <a href="https://www.vbidebate.com/">Victory Briefs Institute</a>.

I also like baking&#127838;, fantasy football&#127944; and roller coasters&#127906;.
